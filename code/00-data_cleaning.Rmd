# Data Review

```{r review data}

# take a look at your df
str(data) # df setup review

# str() tells us that our df has 312 rows and 9 columns and that our sample_id and site number are being treated as integers; this might be a problem in analyses and plotting.

summary(data) # df stats for each column

# summary() tells us a few useful things: (1) our lat/ long bounds which we'll need for mapping, (2) we have NA values in p450 and condition_factor that need to be investigated before moving forward.

```

# Dealing with NA's

```{r }

# Fixing NAs or errant values

# replace 0's with NA, we can ignore them in further analyses
data$p450[data$p450 <= 0] <- NA

# replace any values below LOQ with imputed LOQ (.5 x LOD), LOD= 0.05
data$sod[data$sod <= 0] <- 0.0025

# check
summary(data)

```

# Column Names - Don't Run 3.7.25

```{r}

# i also noticed that all of my column names aren't lowercase, so let's fix that to prevent unnecessary mistakes
#colnames(data) <- tolower(colnames(data))

```

# don't forget to write out this table, i keep skipping that in this file.
