# Data Review

```{r review data}

# take a look at your df
str(data) # df setup review

# str() tells us that our df has 312 rows and 9 columns and that our sample_id and site number are being treated as integers; this might be a problem in analyses and plotting.

summary(data) # df stats for each column

# summary() tells us a few useful things: (1) our lat/ long bounds which we'll need for mapping, (2) we have NA values in p450 and condition_factor that need to be investigated before moving forward.

```

# Dealing with NA's - Don't Run

```{r }

# Fixing NAs or learning to live with them

# replace p450 NAs (n=8) with the median
data$p450[is.na(data$p450)] <- 3873418

# replace condition_factor NAs (n=16) with the median
data$condition_factor[is.na(data$condition_factor)] <- 0.1738

# check
summary(data)

```

# Column Names - Don't Run

```{r}

# i also noticed that all of my column names aren't lowercase, so let's fix that to prevent unnecessary mistakes
colnames(data) <- tolower(colnames(data))

```

# Normality

```{r}

# distribution normality or non-normality our analysis path, let's check
# test assumes normality, so any p-value > .05 indicates a rejection of that assumption

shapiro.test(data$p450) # P450 is NOT normal
shapiro.test(data$sod) # SOD is NOT normal
shapiro.test(data$ci_wet_volume) # CI_wet_volume is NOT normal
shapiro.test(data$ci_pollution) # CI_pollution is NOT normal
shapiro.test(data$shell_thickness) # Shell_Thickness is normal
