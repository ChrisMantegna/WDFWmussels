# Load & Check Data

getwd()

# load data

# check it out
str(data) # checking df structure
# note that sample_id and site_number are integers and may need to be adjusted to characters for analysis

summary(data) #checking df contents

```

Move the initial stats out of data cleaning file and put them here.
Tests of Normality and Variance indicate KW test + Dunn posthoc for all metrics except Shell Thickness which was normally distributed.
