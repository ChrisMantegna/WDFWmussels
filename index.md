# Community Guidelines

REPLACE WITH THE CORRECT CONTENT.
I am dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students, regardless of their background, identity, physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be tolerated. This applies to all course participants (instructor, students, guests). In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, I ask the following:

* Please let me know if you have a name or set of preferred pronouns that you would like me to use

* Please let me know if *anyone* in class says something that makes you feel uncomfortable<sup>[[1](#endnotes)]</sup>

In addition, I encourage the following kinds of behaviors:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language

* Show courtesy and respect towards others

* Acknowledge different viewpoints and experiences

* Gracefully accept constructive criticism

Although I strive to create and use inclusive materials in this course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due to the lens with which it was written. Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course are encouraged and appreciated.  

**Please note**: If you believe you have been a victim of an alleged violation of the [Student Conduct Code](https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html) or you are aware of an alleged violation of the [Student Conduct Code](https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html), you have the right to [report it to the University](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students-2/).

### Title IX

For support, resources, and reporting options related to sex- and gender-based violence or harassment, visit [UW Title IX’s webpage](https://www.washington.edu/titleix/), specifically the [Know Your Rights & Resources](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/181/2020/08/10185033/KYRR-guide-8-10-2020-LINKED.pdf) guide. 

Please know that if you choose to disclose information to me about sex- or gender-based violence or harassment, I will connect you (or the person who experienced the conduct) with resources and individuals who can best provide support and options. You can also access those resources directly:

* **Confidential**: [Confidential advocates](https://www.washington.edu/sexualassault/support/advocacy/) will not share information with others unless given express permission by the person who has experienced the harm or when required by law.

* **Private and/or anonymous**: [SafeCampus](SafeCampus) provides consultation and support and can connect you with additional resources if you want them.You can contact SafeCampus anonymously or share limited information when you call.

Please note that some senior leaders and other specified employees have been identified as "[Officials Required to Report](https://www.washington.edu/titleix/title-ix-officials-required-to-report/)". If an Official Required to Report learns of possible sex- or gender-based violence or harassment, they are required to call SafeCampus and report all the details they have in order to ensure that the person who experienced harm is offered support and reporting options.

# Access & accommodations

All students deserve access to the full range of learning experiences, and the University of Washington is committed to creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state laws. If you feel like your performance in class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with me.

# Technology

This course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to work with one another. **For students without access to a personal laptop**: it is possible to check out UW laptops for an entire quarter (see the [Student Services office](https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services) for details).

Students will be required to have a user account on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/), which we will be using for file hosting and communications via its "Discussions" and "Issues" features. If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for a free one [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). The instructor will provide training on how to use the intended features in **GitHub**.

<br>

# Teaching methodology

This course will introduce new material primarily through prepared slides and hands-on demonstrations. Students will be expected to work both individually and collaboratively (to the extent possible given the current conditions); course content and evaluation will emphasize the communication of ideas and the ability to think critically more so than a specific pathway or method. Other areas of this website provide an overview of the topics to be covered, including links to weekly reading assignments, lecture materials, and homework assignments.

# Penultimate Topic

No student should ever have to choose between buying food or textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at **no cost**. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days' worth of supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the [Any Hungry Husky website](https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky) for additional information, including operating hours and additional food support resources.
