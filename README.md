# Utilizing biochemical biomarkers to characterize *Mytilus trossulus* response to contamination in Puget Sound waterways
--- 
### This work is being conducted in collaboration with the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife. The samples are a subset of mussels from the 2021/22 mussel outplanting for the ongoing 'Mussel Watch' program.
